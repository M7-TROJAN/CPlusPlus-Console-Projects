# Math Quiz

The Math Quiz is a simple command-line game that tests your mathematical skills by generating random arithmetic questions. It provides different levels of difficulty and various arithmetic operations to challenge your abilities.

## Getting Started

To run the Math Quiz game on your device, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository.

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.

3. Build and compile the source code.

4. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

## Game Rules

1. At the beginning of the game, you will be prompted to enter the number of questions you want to answer, the level of difficulty, and the type of arithmetic operation.

2. Choose the number of questions between 1 and 100.

3. Select the level of difficulty:

    - Very Easy
    - Easy
    - Medium
    - Hard
    - Very Hard

4. Choose the type of arithmetic operation:

    - Mix (combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)

5. Once the game starts, you will be presented with each question one by one.

6. Enter your answer for each question.

7. After answering all the questions, the game will display your results, including the total number of questions, the level of difficulty, the operation type, the number of correct and wrong answers, the score in percentage, and the test result (pass or fail).

8. You will have the option to play again or exit the game.

## Game Features

- Randomly generates arithmetic questions based on the chosen level of difficulty and operation type.
- Provides immediate feedback on each answer (correct or wrong) with the correct answer displayed if the response is incorrect.
- Calculates the score in percentage based on the number of correct answers.
- Displays a pass or fail message based on the test result.
- Allows the option to play the game again with a fresh set of questions.

## System Requirements

To run the Math Quiz game, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- C++ compiler, use a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
- Windows operating system (compatible with the included Windows API calls)

## Note
The game provides feedback on each answer, indicating whether it is correct or wrong. It also displays the correct answer if you answered incorrectly.

Please note that this code does not include error handling for all possible scenarios, and it assumes the input data is well-formed. You may need to enhance the code based on your specific requirements and use cases.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your needs. If you have any further questions, please let me know!
