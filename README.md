# C++ Programming Language Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing a collection of diverse C++ programming projects developed during my training journey. Each project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in C++ programming concepts and software development practices. These projects are designed to provide insight into logical problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and effective coding practices.

## Project List

1. **ATM System Project:** Offers a comprehensive simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) with a user-friendly interface and innovative features to manage banking transactions.
   
2. **Client Management System Project:** A user-friendly system to manage client information, highlighting data structures, strings handling, Mathematical processing, and file handling.
   
3. **Math Quiz Project:** Interactive math quiz game for educational purposes, displaying dynamic input-output handling.
   
4. **Rock Paper Scissors Project:** Classic game implementation featuring a user-friendly interface and exciting gameplay based on conditional statements and randomization.
   
5. **Date Class Project:** A versatile date manipulation library for handling dates, calculating differences, and more.
   
6. **Custom_String Class Project:** Extending C++ string class to create a custom_string class with additional functionalities.
    
7. **My Own String Class Project:** Building a string class from scratch, covering string manipulation and memory management.
    
8. **FreePalestine Project:**  A console application designed to display the Palestinian flag, symbolizing solidarity and support. This project serves as a visual representation and message of peace, unity, and support for Palestine. It showcases the flag using C++ console output, demonstrating a symbolic gesture within a programming context.
   
9. **ProgrammingTest** A console application designed to evaluate the user's knowledge of programming fundamentals. The system presents a series of multiple-choice questions from a predefined question bank, records the user's performance, and provides a detailed result summary. The project includes modular code organized into several files for maintainability and scalability.
