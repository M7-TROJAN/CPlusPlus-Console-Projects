Client Management System:
------------------------
This is a Simple command-line Client Management System program written in C++. It allows you to perform various operations on client records, such as adding new clients, updating client information, deleting clients, finding clients by account number, and displaying a list of all clients.

The program provides a command-line interface where users can interact with the system. It displays a main menu with options for different operations. Users can choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding menu number.

The client records are stored in a structured format, where each record represents a client and contains fields such as account number, PIN code, name, phone number, and account balance. The records are read from and written to the Clients.txt file using a specific delimiter ("##") to separate the fields.

The program includes various utility functions for handling user input validation, file operations, and data manipulation. These functions ensure the correctness and integrity of the client records.

Important Note:
---------------
This project is intended for training purposes and demonstrates skills in file handling, word processing, logical reasoning, and other relevant areas. The provided source code includes functions for managing client data, such as creating new clients, updating client information, depositing balance, and deleting clients.
The code implements basic functionalities for a client management system. Please note that this is a simplified project and may not include advanced features or security measures that would be required in a real-world application.

Features:
--------
- Adding new clients: You can add new clients to the system by providing their account number, pin code, name, phone number, and account balance.
- Updating client information: You can update the information of an existing client by entering their account number and then providing the updated details.
- Deleting clients: You can delete a client from the system by specifying their account number.
- Finding clients: You can find a client by their account number and view their details.
- Displaying all clients: You can view a list of all clients currently stored in the system.

How to Run the Program:
-----------------------
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub.
3. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
4. Build and compile the source code.
5. Run the executable file generated.

Usage:
-----
1. Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler.
2. The program will display a main menu with options for different operations.
3. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number and pressing Enter.
4. Follow the prompts and provide the required information.
5. The program will perform the selected operation and display the result or any relevant messages.
6. After completing an operation, you will be returned to the main menu.
7. To exit the program, choose the "Exit" option from the main menu.

Code Review:
-----------
Here are some key points about the code structure and implementation:

- The program uses file I/O to read and write client data to a file named "Clients.txt". The file is read and loaded into memory when the program starts, and changes are saved back to the file when necessary.
- The stClientData struct represents a client record and stores the account number, pin code, name, phone number, account balance, and a flag to mark records for deletion.
- The program provides various helper functions to handle input validation, string manipulation, and file operations.
- The main functionality is divided into separate functions for each operation, such as adding clients, updating clients, deleting clients, and finding clients.
- The program uses a vector to store and manipulate client records in memory.
- The code includes error handling for file operations and invalid input.

Note:
-----------
The project assumes a specific format for the Clients.txt file, where each line represents a client record with fields separated by "##". Any changes to the file format may require modifications in the code.

Please note that this code does not include error handling for all possible scenarios, and it assumes the input data is well-formed. You may need to enhance the code based on your specific requirements and use cases.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your needs. If you have any further questions, please let me know!
